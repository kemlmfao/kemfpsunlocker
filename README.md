## FAQ

1. **Roblox is force-closing, files are being deleted, and/or my anti-virus is detecting kemfpsunlocker as malware. What do I do?**

All detections are false positives. Internally, KFU "tampers" with running Roblox processes in order to uncap framerate and can appear as suspicious to an anti-virus. A simple way to fix is just disable your anti-virus.

2. **How can I see my FPS?**

Press `Shift+F5` in-game to view your FPS. In Roblox Studio, go to View->Stats->Summary.

3. **How do I resolve choppiness and input lag at high framerates?**

Try entering fullscreen using `Alt+Enter` or in `esc > settings > fullscreen > on`.

4. **Can I set a custom framerate cap?**

You can create your own list of FPS cap values by editing the `FPSCapValues` array inside the `settings` file located in the same folder as `kemfpsunlocker.exe`.
